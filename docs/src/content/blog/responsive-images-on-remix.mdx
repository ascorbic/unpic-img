Unlike many other frameworks, Remix doesn't have a built-in way to generate
responsive images. This is in keeping with its philosophy of using the web
platform, but it does make it quite a bit more work to get responsive images set
up. A lot of people want something that's like next/image for Remix. This is
just the place where Unpic shines. If you've not met it, Unpic is a
cross-framework library for generating `<img>` tags that are responsive,
high-performance and follow modern best practices. While I had used Unpic with
Hydrogen (because Shopify support is built-in and automatic), I hadn't tried it
yet with local images on Remix. I'm happy to report that it works great! It
literally took my less than five minutes to get it working. Here's how.

## How to generate responsive images on Remix with Unpic

First, install Unpic with the package mananger of choice.

```bash
npm install @unpic/react
```

Then, use it in your page:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@unpic/react";
// This is a local image import
import viaduct from "../viaduct.jpg";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Image
        src={viaduct}
        alt="A viaduct"
        width={800}
        height={600}
        cdn="netlify"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Seriously, that's it. End of blog.

## How it works

OK, maybe I'll explain it a bit more. First, what does it do? In this example,
we're importing a local image using
[asset imports](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/asset-imports).
This copies the source image into the output directory with a fingerprinted
filename, then returns the URL. We can use this directly in Unpic.

Unpic doesn't resize images itself. Instead it uses your existing image CDN,
recognises the URL and generates the correct attributes for the `<img>` tag,
including the full `srcset` with all the image sizes. It automatically uses
modern formats like AVIF and WebP if the browser supports it. In this case, I'm
using Netlify's image CDN which is enabled on all Netlify sites. Vercel works in
the same way. Other CDNs will also work, but may need a few more options.

This is the generated tag. You will see it has everything to create a responsive
image. It resizes fluidly, loads the right resolutions depending on the screen
size. You'll also find it gives great scores on Lighthouse and other performance
tools.

```html
<img
  alt="Viaduct"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  sizes="(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"
  style="object-fit:cover;max-width:800px;max-height:600px;aspect-ratio:1.333;width:100%"
  srcset="
    /.netlify/images?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg    640w,
    /.netlify/images?w=750&amp;h=563&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg    750w,
    /.netlify/images?w=800&amp;h=600&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg    800w,
    /.netlify/images?w=828&amp;h=621&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg    828w,
    /.netlify/images?w=960&amp;h=720&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg    960w,
    /.netlify/images?w=1080&amp;h=810&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg  1080w,
    /.netlify/images?w=1280&amp;h=960&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg  1280w,
    /.netlify/images?w=1600&amp;h=1200&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg 1600w
  "
  src="/.netlify/images?w=800&amp;h=600&amp;fit=cover&amp;url=%2Fbuild%2F_assets%2Fviaduct-N2EIOTOR.jpg"
/>
```

## Using remote images

Unpic also recognises loads of remote image sources, and can generate URLs
without needing a local image service. It supports most CMSs, including
Contentful, Sanity, DatoCMS and many more, as well as other services like
Shopify, Cloudinary and Unsplash.

Here's an editable example using an Unsplash image. Try it with your own images
from your CMS. Just paste in the URL.

<CodeEditor
  client:load
  code={`
   // Or try this: "https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/dog"

    <Image
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601418059872-2ac6d694946d"
      width={400}
      height={300}
      alt="Remix"
    />

`} />

Try inspecting the image to see the attributes.

This is just using the default options. Take a look at the
[the docs](/img/react) to see what else is available, including different crop
options, props for full-width hero images and fixed-size images like logos.
