import { Image } from "@unpic/astro";

Unpic is the best way to display images on the web. With components for ten
different frontend frameworks, almost every site can have fast, responsive
images with very little effort. After two years of development, I'm excited to
announce the first stable release of Unpic. To jump straight in, see [the guide to upgrading to v1](/upgrading-to-v1).

Since starting work on Unpic two years ago, I've been astounded by the response
from the community. With over 50,000 npm downloads per week, 1500 stars and a
growing number of contributors on GitHub, it's clear that developers really need
a good way to handle images. It's not surprising - images are a huge part of the
web, and getting them right can be hard. I built Unpic to make it as easy as an
img tag.

This release includes a completely-rewritten core library, now with support for
[26 different image providers](/providers), and
[ten different frontend frameworks](/img). One development that I have found
particularly exciting it how many people have used Unpic at the core of their
own image components. This release is designed to make that easier than ever. A
new modular architecture keeps it just as easy to use as before, but adds new
base components that let you bring your own transformer functions without
needing to bundle the whole library, or import individual, tree-shakable
providers.

## Meet Unpic

If you're new to Unpic, it's a family of image components make it as easy to
create a responsive image as it is to use an `<img>` tag. It uses your existing
image CDN or CMS with no additional configuration. It's designed to be as simple
as possible to use, with no configuration needed, but with the flexibility to
handle any image URL. Most images on modern websites are hosted on a CDN or CMS
that has built-in support for image transforms, but existing frontend frameworks
often download and resize the image at build time or on your server, rather than
using the native host. Unpic uses the CDN to resize the image on the fly,
delivering the correct size for the user's device and screen size. It generates
the correct HTML tags, and lightweight styles to make the image resize
responsively.

This is how to use the `Image` component from `@unpic/react`:

```jsx
import { Image } from "@unpic/react";

export const MyImage = () => (
  <Image
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/dog"
    width={600}
    height={300}
    alt="Dog"
  />
);
```

This generates the following HTML:

```html
<img
  alt="Dog"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  sizes="(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"
  style="object-fit:cover;max-width:600px;max-height:300px;aspect-ratio:2;width:100%"
  srcset="
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_600,h_300,f_auto,c_lfill/dog   600w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_640,h_320,f_auto,c_lfill/dog   640w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_750,h_375,f_auto,c_lfill/dog   750w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_828,h_414,f_auto,c_lfill/dog   828w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_960,h_480,f_auto,c_lfill/dog   960w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_1080,h_540,f_auto,c_lfill/dog 1080w,
    https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_1200,h_600,f_auto,c_lfill/dog 1200w
  "
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_600,h_300,f_auto,c_lfill/dog"
/>
```

Look at that puppy!

<Image
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/dog"
  width={600}
  height={300}
  alt="Dog"
/>

No configuration is needed at all. Unpic detects that this is a Cloudinary URL,
and uses the Cloudinary transformer to generate the correct image sizes and
formats. It also generates the correct `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for the
image, and adds the correct `loading` and `decoding` attributes to ensure the
image is loaded quickly and responsively. The resulting image is responsive and
fast, but as easy to use as a basic img tag.

## Supported frameworks and providers

Unpic supports ten different frontend frameworks, and 26 different image
providers. The supported frameworks are:

[Angular](/img/angular) • [Astro](/img/astro) • [Lit](/img/lit) •
