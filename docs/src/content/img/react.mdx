import { CodeEditor } from "../../components/CodeEditor";

A high-performance, responsive image components for
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Generates a
responsive `<img>` tag that follows best practices, with the correct srcset,
sizes and styles. Detects image URLs from most image CDNs and CMSs and can
resize images with no build step.

## Installation

Install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @unpic/react
```

Import it into your component:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@unpic/react";
```

## Usage

> 💡 These examples are all editable

<CodeEditor
  client:visible
  code={`
    <Image
      src="https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg"
      layout="constrained"
      width={400}
      height={300}
      alt="A lovely bath"
    />
`}
/>

## Unpic for Next.js

If you are using Next.js, you can use the `@unpic/react/nextjs` component. This
works the same as the main `@unpic/react` component, but also supports the
Next.js Image Optimizer for images that don't use a supported CDN. This includes
local images, either using a path or an import.

### Usage

The component is part of the `@unpic/react` package, so you install it in the
same way:

```bash
npm install @unpic/react
```

Then, in your Next.js project, import the component from `@unpic/react/nextjs`:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@unpic/react/nextjs";
import logo from "../public/logo.png";

// You can use both local images, and ones from image CDNs
<Image src={logo} alt="Logo" layout="constrained" />

<Image
  src="https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/garnished.jpeg"
  layout="constrained"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  alt="Shopify product"
/>
```

> ⚠️ For versions of Next.js before 13.5, import from
> `@unpic/react/next-legacy`, not `@unpic/react/nextjs`

### Differences from `next/image`

The `@unpic/react/next` component is similar in concept to `next/image`, and can
use the same image optimizer. However, it has a number of differences that may
mean you prefer to use it instead.

When unpic-img detects that you are using a supported CDN it will load the
images from there directly, using the CDN's own image resizing rather than
Next.js. This saves the need to process the image twice, and means that you can
use the more powerful features of the image CDN.

Unlike `next/image`, unpic-img will not distort the image to fit the requested
size as it uses `object-fit: cover` by default, and if using a supported CDN it
will crop the image to the requested aspect ratio.

There is no need to specify a loader, because unpic-img will automatically
detect the CDN and use the correct loader, and supports many more than Next.js.

unpic-img includes three built-in layout modes: `fixed`, `constrained`, and
`fullWidth`. These affect how the image resizes, but also allows smarter
generation of the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes. See below for an example:
