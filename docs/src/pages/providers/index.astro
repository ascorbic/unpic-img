  <p>
    Unpic can transform images using all of these services, with type-safe
    operations and config options. A lot of other services use these under the
    hood and can often also be detected. For example, most CMSs use Imgix and
    will work with additional configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most providers can be auto-detected, so work with zero config. However if
    you want to use extra features and configuration, check out the
    provider-specific docs below.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to add a provider, see <a href="/lib/contributing"
      >the contributing guide</a
    >.
