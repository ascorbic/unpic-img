# Eleventy WebC Number Counter Demo

A progressively enhanced server-rendered form-aware web component counter using WebC.

This enhances from an `<input type="number">` to a JS-enhanced `<my-counter>` Web Component Custom Element so that number input still works before JS or in a JS-broken environment.
