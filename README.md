## Features

- Just an `<img>` tag! No extra elements, no runtime JavaScript. Easy to style. No legacy hacks or workarounds.
- Automatically generates correct srcset and sizes attributes for responsive images.
- Handles responsive resizing of images, preserving aspect ratio and avoiding layout shift.
- Uses native lazy loading and async decoding for offscreen images.
- Handles different image layouts: fixed, constrained and full width.
- Uses eager loading and high priority fetching for important images.
- Delivers modern image formats, including WebP and AVIF if supported by the browser.
- No build step or server-side rendering required for the images: uses your existing image CDN or CMS, with no additional configuration.

## FAQ

### Why do I need this?

While it's easy to use an `<img>` tag for images, if you want to follow best practices and deliver the most performant image to your users then it can take a lot of work. Some frontend frameworks will automate this for you, but they often rely on slow pre-rendering of images, or on running image optimizers on your own site. They also generate complex HTML with wrappers and spacer elements that make images hard to style.

Most images on modern websites are hosted on a CDN or CMS that can resize images on the fly and deliver them at the edge. Despite this, most web frameworks will still download and resize the image at build time or on your server, rather than using the CDN, or just uses a single source image rather than handling multiple resolutions.

This library works with any frontend framework or none, and uses your existing image CDN or CMS, with no additional configuration.

For more details, see [this post](https://dev.to/ascorbic/a-minimal-multi-framework-responsive-image-component-3iop).

## How does this work?

This library uses unpic to detect the image CDN, and then uses the CDN's URL API to resize and format images. It then generates the correct `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for the image. It uses new features built into modern browsers to handle lazy loading, fetch priority and decoding. It also uses pure CSS to handle responsive resizing of images, preserving aspect ratio and avoiding layout shift. Unlike most other image components, it does not use any client-side JavaScript by default, and generates just a single `<img>` tag without any wrapper divs or padding elements.

## What HTML does this generate?

<details>
<summary>Generated HTML for a constrained image</summary>
It turns this:

```tsx
<Image
  src="https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath_grande_crop_center.jpeg"
  layout="constrained"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  alt="Shopify"
/>
```

...into this:

```html
<img
  alt="Shopify"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  sizes="(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"
  srcset="
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=1600&amp;height=2133 1600w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=1280&amp;height=1707 1280w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=960&amp;height=1280   960w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=828&amp;height=1104   828w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=800&amp;height=1067   800w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=750&amp;height=1000   750w,
    https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?crop=center&amp;width=640&amp;height=853    640w
  "
  src="https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath.jpeg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;crop=center"
  style="
        object-fit: cover;
        max-width: 800px;
        max-height: 600px;
        aspect-ratio: 1.33333 / 1;
        width: 100%;
      "
/>
```

## Props

The component accepts all the props of an `<img>` tag, plus the following:

### `layout`

The resizing behaviour of the image.

- `fullWidth`: the image will be rendered at full width of its container. This is optimized for full-width hero images. You can set `height` to a fixed value, which will mean the image will be rendered at that fixed height and scale horizontally to fill the container.
- `constrained`: the image will be rendered at a maximum of `width` and `height`, but will scale down automatically if the container is smaller, maintaining the aspect ratio.
- `fixed`: the image will be rendered at the exact size specified by `width` and `height`

![image-layouts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/213306/217186596-f67c54fe-6613-497f-9577-7868226ed7d9.gif)

### `priority`

By default, images are loaded lazily. If `priority` is set to `true`, the image will be loaded eagerly, and will be given high priority by the browser. This is useful for images that are above the fold, particularly large ones such as hero images.

### `background`

Either an image URL, CSS gradient or CSS colour value. If set to `auto`, a low-resolution version of the image will be rendered as a background image, with a blurred placeholder effect. This is still loaded from the remote server, so if you can instead provide an inline base64-encoded version of the image or background colour, you should do that instead. Bear in mind that this is not removed after the image loads, so it will be visible if the image has transparency.

### `aspectRatio`

Instead of specifying both `width` and `height`, you can specify can `aspectRatio`.

### `cdn`

By default the CDN is auto-detected from the `src` URL. If you want to override this, you can specify a CDN object. See the [unpic](https://github.com/ascorbic/unpic) for supported values.

### `breakpoints`

By default the image breakpoints used in the `srcset` are generated based on the layout and image size. You can override this by specifying an array of breakpoints. The breakpoints are specified as an array of numbers, representing the width of the image in pixels.

## Other props

Any prop supported by `<img>` tags can be passed in, except `srcset` which is generated from `src`. The following props are set automatically, but can be overridden if you need to:

- `sizes`
- `role`
- `decoding`
- `loading`
- `fetchpriority`

## Supported CDNs

You can use any image CDN supported by [unpic](https://github.com/ascorbic/unpic), including:

- Imgix, including Unsplash, DatoCMS, Sanity and Prismic
- Contentful
- Cloudinary
- Shopify
- Builder.io
- Cloudflare Image Resizing
- Storyblok
- WordPress.com and Jetpack Site Accelerator
- Bunny.net

## Browser support

Many of the performance features use `<img>` attributes that are only supported in modern browsers. However it is still an `<img>` tag, so it will degrade gracefully in older browsers. It uses the `aspect-ratio` and `object-fit` CSS properties, which are supported in all modern browsers but will not degrade gracefully in older browsers. This means that in older browsers the image may appear stretched or squashed if not explicitly sized. See [the browser support table](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio) for more details.
