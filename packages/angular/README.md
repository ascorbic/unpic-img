## Installation and usage

```bash
npm install @unpic/angular
```

Add to app module:

```typescript
// ..
import { UnpicModule } from "@unpic/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  imports: [BrowserModule, UnpicModule],
})
```

You can then use it by adding the `unpic` attribute to an `<img>` tag:

```html
<img unpic src="https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sample-images/bath_crop_center.jpeg" layout="constrained" width="800" height="600" alt="A lovely bath" />
```

For the supported props, see [the docs](https://unpic.pics/img/angular).
